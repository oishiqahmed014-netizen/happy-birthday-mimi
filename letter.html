    <h2>Mimi,</h2>

    <div class="letter-text">
      I want to tell you something. I've been feeling so down lately. It's like I want to tell you so many things, but I'm not brave enough to open up. I'm afraid that you'll find me weird and see me as a creep. I don't want you to grow distant from me no matter what. Mimi, I- I've never felt like this before. I've never been attached to someone like this before. I started loving you since the day we first met and the love kept getting stronger everyday. Now I just can't stop thinking about you. From waking up  to going to bed, you are always in my mind. There hasn't been a single night I didn't fall asleep thinking about you. Now you are in everything. I stayed up all night knowing damn well I was gonna be so tired the next day, but it didn't matter to me. Cuz, spending time with you was always more important to me.
You never leave my mind even when I have a million things to worry about. You are a part of my life that I can't let go. Before you came into my life, I wasn't like this. I was emotionally distant from others and I never had these intense feelings for someone before. My life has become totally different since you came into my life. You've brightened my every single day. No matter how horrible my day was, talking to you for even just a minute made my day. I felt comfort around you. I felt safe. I felt loved. Mimi- I'm so scared of losing you. I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU NO MATTER WHAT. Heh, how can I think about leaving you when I couldn't stay even a single day without talking to you. I probably told you like a hundred times that I was leaving the next day during my exams, but I came back every single time. You have a very special place in my heart that no one could ever have and most likely never will. You are my favorite person in the world. In fact, you are more than that. You always make me happy cuz I know you're always here with me. "I don't care how long it takes, As long as I'm with you, I've got a smile on my face." Please don't let me go mimi. you know that even the thought of losing you makes me panic and cry. I'll go insane without you mimi. I don't know if I am being possessive or something, but I'm scared that someone else might take the one person who made me feel seen. I don't want anyone else to take the space that feels like mine.
You know I had a crazy ego back then, but I put you over everything. You are the one who can call me anything. I can be the dumbest person in the world for you. Fk, I'm so annoying, ain't I?
I want you to always be happy and I truly care for you.
<br><br/>Mimi- I don't know what it really is, but- you're the one my soul wants to hold on to---forever.
My heart keeps aching for you. I feel like I can't stay without you.<br><br/>
MIMI-<br><br/>
I LOVE YOU.<br><br/>
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING.<br><br/>
I WANT YOU TO BE WITH ME-<br><br/>
I-<br><br/>
I NEED YOU.
