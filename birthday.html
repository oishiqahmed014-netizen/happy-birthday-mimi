      Happy Birthday My Love. I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I hope you know that I'm always so proud of you. 
      You are my everything. It's a really special day for not only you, but for me too. So in this day, I hope you have lots of fun
      and keep smiling. I always want to see that sweet smile of yours. It's so precious. I know I'm not there with you in person today,
      but I'm always here, whenever you want me. And soon, you and me, both will celebrate your birthday together every year.
      I want to celebrate every single birthday of yours for the rest of my life. I always want to make you happy. I love you so much 
      darling &#60;3

      Today is all about you my love. Always remember
      how deeply loved you are. 💜
